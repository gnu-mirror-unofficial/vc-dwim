* Noteworthy changes in release 1.9 (2019-12-23) [stable]

** New features

  vc-dwim and vc-chlog now also work with git worktree directories

  vc-dwim accepts a new option: --dry-run (-n)


* Noteworthy changes in release 1.8 (2017-01-14) [stable]

** New features

  vc-dwim accepts a new option: --initialize

  vc-dwim now supports darcs.

  vc-dwim now silently ignores dirty git submodules


* Noteworthy changes in release 1.7 (2013-03-15) [stable]

** Bug fixes

  vc-dwim now applies --author= for ChangeLog-derived name/email for bzr,
  just like it has always done for git.


* Noteworthy changes in release 1.6 (2011-12-23) [stable]

** Bug fixes

  vc-dwim now works even when you set GIT_EXTERNAL_DIFF

  vc-dwim no longer fails when it encounters a ChangeLog line like
  "* file (...)" (i.e., with no colon) when that line ends with a ")".

  "vc-dwim a/ChangeLog b/ChangeLog" would mistakenly complain about
  an "--author/ChangeLog mismatch" even though the two name/email
  pairs in the ChangeLog files were identical.

** Changes in behavior

  vc-dwim now warns when you forget to add a one-line summary


* Noteworthy changes in release 1.5 (2011-05-20) [stable]

** Bug fixes

  vc-dwim: when the added ChangeLog date-name-email header is identical
  to the preceding one, vc-dwim would put that line at the end of the
  commit log whenever diff output listed the new, topmost, header only
  as context lines in the ChangeLog diff output.  That bug is fixed.


* Noteworthy changes in release 1.4 (2011-03-18) [stable]

  vc-chlog can now handle two-word function names like "operator delete"

  vc-chlog now accepts --dirty-workdir for 'git add -i' workflows.


* Noteworthy changes in release 1.3 (2010-11-06) [stable]

  vc-dwim now commits the symlink'd ChangeLog *after* the primary commit,
  not before it.  This is more useful because the primary one is far more
  likely to fail, e.g., due to a commit hook.  Now, when that happens, the
  ChangeLog delta is left uncommitted, as you probably require, so that you
  can run vc-dwim after correcting the problem with the primary commit.


* Noteworthy changes in release 1.2 (2009-09-08) [stable]

  vc-dwim no longer occasionally inserts a "SCALAR(0x...)" line into
  the commit log message.

  vc-chlog now detects removed files in a git tree.

  vc-chlog accepts a --no-functions option to disable identifier extraction.


* Noteworthy changes in release 1.1 (2009-06-20) [stable]

  vc-dwim supports bzr.

  A xz tarball is provided instead of an lzma one.

  A texinfo manual is provided.


* Major changes in release 1.0 (2007-10-11)

  vc-dwim no longer relies on cg (cogito)

  vc-dwim accepts the new option: --author='User Name <user@example.org>'

  vc-dwim automatically attributes (via git-commit's --author option)
  changes written by someone else.

  vc-chlog now has heuristics for matching the end of functions.

* Major changes in release 0.2.2 (2006-11-10)

  new tool vc-chlog for generating proto ChangeLog entries.

  vc-dwim can handle more diff syntax, including what you get
  after a rename via git-mv.

** Bug fixes

  build framework is more portable


* public release 0.2 (2006-09-21)
